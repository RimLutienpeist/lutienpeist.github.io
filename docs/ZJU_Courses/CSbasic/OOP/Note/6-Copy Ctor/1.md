For the code below

```cpp
void f() {
 	Stash students();
 …
}
```

- Which statement is RIGHT for the line in function f()?
  - This is a variable definition, while students is an object of Stash, initialized w/ default ctor.
  - This is a function prototype, while students is a function returns an object of Stash.
  - This is a function call.
  - **This is illegal in C++.**

**Correct Usages:**

Function Prototype:

```cpp
void f(Stash students); // Declares f taking a Stash argument
```

Variable Definition:

```cpp
Stash students; // Creates a variable students of type Stash
```

Function Call (assuming students is a defined function):

```cpp
students(); // Calls the function students
```

## Copying

Create a new object from an existing one

Copying is implemented by the **copy constructor**

- Has the unique signature `T::T(const T&);`

C++ builds a copy ctor for you if you don't provide one!

#### What if class contains pointers?  Choices!

## Character strings

In C++, a character string is an array of characters with a special terminator — `‘\0’` or ASCII `null`

> The string “C++” is represented, in memory, by an array of four characters
