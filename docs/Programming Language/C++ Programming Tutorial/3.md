# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

[TOC]

### 1. Why OOP?

#### 1.1 Traditional Procedural-Oriented languages

Traditional procedural-oriented languages (such as C and Pascal) suffer some notable drawbacks in creating reusable software components:

1. The programs are made up of functions. Functions are often not *reusable*. 
   1. It is very difficult to copy a function from one program and reuse in another program because the the function is likely to reference the headers, global variables and other functions. 

2. The procedural languages are not suitable of *high-level abstraction* for solving real life problems.
   1. Imagine using assembly codes, which is a very low level code, to write a computer soccer game. C is better but no much better.

In brief, the traditional procedural-languages ***separate* the data structures and algorithms of the software entities.**

#### 1.2 Object-Oriented Programming Languages

The basic unit of OOP is a ***class***, which encapsulates both the *static attributes* and *dynamic behaviors* within a "box", and specifies the public interface for using these boxes. In other words, OOP combines the data structures and algorithms of a software entity inside the same box.

#### ![OOP_Objects.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RimLutienpeist/image-hosting/main/OOP_Objects.png)

OOP languages permit *higher level of abstraction* for solving real-life problems. 

The traditional procedural language forces you to think in terms of the structure of the computer (e.g. memory bits and bytes, array, decision, loop) rather than thinking in terms of the problem you are trying to solve. 

The OOP languages (such as Java, C++, C#) let you think in the problem space, and use software objects to represent and abstract entities of the problem space to solve the problem.

### 2. OOP Basics

#### 2.1 Classes & Instances

**Class**: A *class is a definition of objects of the same kind*. 

In other words, a *class* is a blueprint, template, or prototype that defines and describes the *static attributes* and *dynamic behaviors* common to all objects of the same kind.

**Instance**: An *instance* is *a realization of a particular item of a class*. 

All the instances of a class have similar properties, as described in the class definition. For example, you can define a class called "`Student`" and create three instances of the class "`Student`" for "`Peter`", "`Paul`" and "`Pauline`".

**The term "*object*" usually refers to *instance*.** 

But it is often used quite loosely, which may refer to a class or an instance.

#### 2.2 A Class is a 3-Compartment Box encapsulating Data and Functions

![OOP_ThreeCompartment.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RimLutienpeist/image-hosting/main/OOP_ThreeCompartment.png)

A class can be visualized as a three-compartment box, as illustrated:

1. ***Classname*** (or identifier): identifies the class.
2. ***Data Members*** or ***Variables*** (or *attributes*, *states*, *fields*)
3. ***Member Functions*** (or *methods*, *behaviors*, *operations*)

In other words, a class encapsulates the static attributes (data) and dynamic behaviors (operations that operate on the data) in a box.

The *data members* and *member functions* are collectively called ***class members***.

**Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class and Instance Diagrams:** The above class diagrams are drawn according to the UML notations. A class is represented as a 3-compartment box, containing name, data members (variables), and member functions, respectively. 

#### 2.3 Class Definition

In C++, we use the keyword `class` to define a class. 

There are two sections in the class declaration: `private` and `public`.

```cpp
class SoccerPlayer {   // classname
private:
   int number;         // Data members (variables)
   string name;
   int x, y;
public:   
   void run();         // Member functions
   void kickBall();
}
```

**Class Naming Convention:** 

1. A classname shall be a noun or a noun phrase made up of several words. 
2. All the words shall be initial-capitalized (camel-case). 
3. Use a *singular* noun for classname. 
4. Choose a meaningful and self-descriptive classname. 
5. For examples, `SoccerPlayer`, `HttpProxyServer`, `FileInputStream`, `PrintStream` and `SocketFactory`.

#### 2.4 Creating Instances of a Class

To create *an instance of a class*, you have to:

1. Declare an instance identifier (name) of a particular class.
2. Invoke(调用) a constructor to construct the instance (i.e., allocate storage for the instance and initialize the variables).

```cpp
SoccerPlayer s1(1,a,2,2,...);
SoccerPlayer s2 = SoccerPlayer(1);
SoccerPlayer s3;
```

#### 2.5 Dot (.) Operator

To reference a *member of a object* (data member or member function), you must:

```cpp
// Declare and construct instances c1 and c2 of the class Circle
Circle c1(1.2, "blue");
Circle c2(3.4, "green");
// Invoke member function via dot operator
cout << c1.getArea() << endl;
cout << c2.getArea() << endl;
// Reference data members via dot operator
c1.radius = 5.5;
c2.radius = 6.6;
```

**Member Function Naming Convention:** 

1. A function name shall be a **verb**, or a verb phrase made up of several words. 
2. The first word is in lowercase and the rest of the words are initial-capitalized (camel-case). 
3. For example, `getRadius()`, `getParameterValues()`.

```cpp
class Circle {
private:
   double radius;      // Data member (Variable)
   string color;       // Data member (Variable)
 
public:
   // Constructor with default values for data members
   Circle(double r = 1.0, string c = "red") {
      radius = r;
      color = c;
   }
};   // need to end the class declaration with a semi-colon
 
int main() {
   // Construct a Circle instance
   Circle c1(1.2, "blue");
   cout << "Radius=" << c1.getRadius() << " Area=" << c1.getArea()
        << " Color=" << c1.getColor() << endl;
}
```

A *constructor* is a special function that has the *function name same as the classname*. 

A constructor is used to construct and *initialize all the data members*. 

To create a new instance of a class, you need to declare the name of the instance and invoke the constructor. For example,

```cpp
Circle c1(1.2, "blue");
Circle c2(3.4);      // default color
Circle c3;           // default radius and color
                     // Take note that there is no empty bracket ()
```

- The name of the constructor is the same as the classname.
- Constructor has no return type (or implicitly returns `void`). Hence, no `return` statement is allowed inside the constructor's body.
- Constructor can only be invoked *once* to initialize the instance constructed. You cannot call the constructor afterwards in your program.
- Constructors are not inherited 

#### 2.10 Default Arguments for Functions

In C++, you can specify the default value for the trailing arguments of a function (including constructor) in the function header. For example,

```cpp
// Function prototype
int sum(int n1, int n2, int n3 = 0, int n4 = 0, int n5 = 0);
 
int main() {
   cout << sum(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) << endl; // 5
   cout << sum(1, 1, 1, 1) << endl;    // 4
   cout << sum(1, 1, 1) << endl;       // 3
   cout << sum(1, 1) << endl;          // 2
// cout << sum(1) << endl;  // error: too few arguments
}
 
// The default values shall be specified in function prototype,
//   not the function implementation
int sum(int n1, int n2, int n3, int n4, int n5) {
   return n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5;
}
```

**UML Notation:** In UML notation, `public` members are denoted with a "`+`", while `private` members with a "`-`" in the class diagram.

**Rule of Thumb:** Do not make any data member `public`, unless you have a good reason.

#### 2.13 Getters and Setters

To allow other to *read* the value of a `private` data member says `xxx`, you shall provide a *get function* (or *getter* or *accessor function*) called `getXxx()`. 

- A getter need not expose the data in raw format. It can process the data and limit the view of the data others will see. 
- Getters shall not modify the data member.

To allow other classes to *modify* the value of a `private` data member says `xxx`, you shall provide a *set function* (or *setter* or *mutator function*) called `setXxx()`. 

- A setter could provide data validation (such as range checking), and transform the raw data into the internal representation.

#### 2.14 Keyword "this"

You can use keyword "`this`" to refer to *this* instance inside a class definition.

One of the main usage of keyword `this` is to resolve ambiguity between the names of **data member** and **function parameter**. 

```cpp
class Circle {
private:
   double radius;                 // Member variable called "radius"
   ......
public:
   void setRadius(double radius) { // Function's argument also called "radius"
      this->radius = radius;
         // "this.radius" refers to this instance's member variable
         // "radius" resolved to the function's argument.
   }
   ......
}
```

"`this`" is actually a *pointer* to this object. 

you could use a prefix (such as `m_`) or suffix (such as `_`) to name the data members to avoid name crashes, like `radius_`, 	`f_radius`.

!!! bug "_xxx"
&emsp;C++ Compiler internally names their data members beginning with a leading underscore (`e.g., _xxx`) and local variables with 2 leading underscores (e.g., `__xxx`).
&emsp;Hence, avoid name **beginning with underscore** in your program.

#### 2.16 Convention for Getters/Setters and Constructors

> 有点混乱

```cpp
class C {
private:
   // A private variable named V of type T
   T V;
public:
   // Constructor
   C(T x) { V = x; }
       // OR
       C(T V) { this->V = V; }
       // OR using member initializer list (to be explained later)
       C(T V) : V(V) { }
 
   // A getter for variable V of type T receives no argument and return a value of type T
   T getV() const { return V; }
 
   // A setter for variable V of type T receives a parameter of type T and return void
   void setV(T x) { V = x; }
   // OR
   void setV(T V) { this->V = V; }
}
```

For a `bool` variable `xxx`, the getter shall be named `isXxx()`, instead of `getXxx()`, as follows:

```cpp
private:
   // Private boolean variable
   bool xxx;
public: 
   // Getter
   bool isXxx() const { return xxx; }
 
   // Setter
   void setXxx(bool x) { xxx = x; }
   // OR
   void setXxx(bool xxx) { this->xxx = xxx; }
```

#### 2.17 Default Constructor

A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters, or having default values for all the parameters.

```cpp
Circle c1;   // Declare c1 as an instance of Circle, and invoke the default constructor
Circle c1(); // Error!
             // (This declares c1 as a function that takes no parameter and returns a Circle instance)
```

If C++, if you did not provide ANY constructor, the compiler automatically provides a default constructor that does nothing. That is,

```cpp
ClassName::ClassName() { }  // Take no argument and do nothing
```

#### 2.18 Constructor's Member Initializer List

Instead of initializing the private data members inside the body of the constructor, as follows:

```cpp
Circle(double r = 1.0, string c = "red") {
   radius = r;
   color = c;
}
```

We can use an alternate syntax called *member initializer list* as follows:

```cpp
Circle(double r = 1.0, string c = "red") : radius(r), color(c) { }
```

Member initializer list is placed after the constructor's header, separated by a colon (`:`). 

For fundamental type, it is equivalent to `*data_member_name* = *parameter_name*`. 

For object, the constructor will be invoked to construct the object. The constructor's body (empty in this case) will be run after the completion of member initializer list.

It is recommended to use member initializer list to initialize all the data members, as it is often **more efficient** than doing assignment inside the constructor's body.

#### 2.19 *Destructor

A *destructor*, similar to constructor, is a special function that has the same name as the classname, with a prefix `~`, e.g., `~Circle()`. 

Destructor is called implicitly when an object is destroyed. Namely, the destructor is called whenever an object's lifetime ends.

> 改：不管你有没有使用，g++都会执行你定义的~circle，导致里面的语句被重复执行

![image-20240320094239645](C:\Users\89620\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240320094239645.png)

If you do not define a destructor, the compiler provides a default, which does nothing.

The destructor may also be called directly, e.g. to destroy an object 

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
   // The default destructor that does nothing
   ~MyClass() { }
......
}
```

##### Advanced Notes

- If your class contains data member which is dynamically allocated (via `new` or `new[]` operator), you need to free the storage via `delete` or `delete[]`.

#### 2.20 *Copy constructor and assignment

A *copy constructor* constructs a new object by copying an existing object of the same type. In other words, a copy constructor takes an argument, which is an object of the same class.

If you do not define a copy constructor, the compiler provides a default which copies all the data members of the given object.

```cpp
Circle c4(7.8, "blue");
Circle c5(c4);
c7 = c6; // memberwise copy assignment
```

The copy constructor is particularly important. When an object is passed into a function *by value*, the copy constructor will be used to make a clone copy of the argument.

- **You could overload the assignment opeator to override the default.**
- The copy constructor, instead of copy assignment operator, is used in declaration:

```cpp
Circle c8 = c6;  
// Invoke the copy constructor, NOT copy assignment operator. Same as Circle c8(c6)
```

- **The default copy assignment operator performs *shadow copy*. It does not copy the dynamically allocated data members created via `new` or `new[]` operator.**
- **The default constructor, default destructor, default copy constructor, default copy assignment operators are known as *special member functions*, in which the compiler will automatically generate a copy if they are used in the program and not explicitly defined.**

### 3. Separating Header and Implementation

For better software engineering, it is recommended that the class declaration and implementation be kept in 2 separate files: declaration is a header file "`.h`"; while implementation in a "`.cpp`". 

This is known as separating the public interface (header declaration) and the implementation. 

Interface is defined by the designer, implementation can be supplied by others. 

While the interface is fixed, different vendors can provide different implementations. 

Furthermore, only the header files are exposed to the users, the implementation can be provided in an object file "`.o`" (or in a library). 

The source code needs not given to the users.

> 除了头文件，class的定义也可以放在`.h`

- C++98/03 does NOT allow you to assign an initial value to a data member (except `const static` members). Date members are to be initialized via the constructor. For example,

  ```cpp
  double radius = 1.0;
     // error: ISO C++ forbids in-class initialization of non-const static member 'radius'
  ```

  C++11 allows in-class initialization of data members.

- You can provide default value to function's arguments in the header. For example,

  ```cpp
  Circle(double radius = 1.0, string color = "red");
  ```

- Header contains function prototype, the parameter names are ignored by the compiler, but good to serve as documentation. For example, you can leave out the parameter names in the prototype as follows:

  ```cpp
  Circle(double = 1.0, string = "red");   // without identifiers
     // Identifiers not needed in prototype but good to serve as documentation
  ```

Header files shall contains constants, function prototypes, class/struct declarations.

- The compiler searches the headers in double quotes (such as `"Circle.h"`) in the *current directory* first, then the system's include directories. 
  - For header in angle bracket (such as `<iostream>`), the compiler does NOT searches the current directory, but only the system's include directories.
